# Console Finances tool / JavaScript

## Overview of Task


For this activity, I mimicked a real world activity in which, by using JavaScript, I created code to analyse the finaincial records of a company. I was provided with the financial dataset which can be viewed in the initial array with the code. 
   
The desired outcome of code was to log the following to the console:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
